We propose a new method of calculating Greenâ€™s functions on a quantum computer in the time domain for condensed matter applications using coupled cluster methods. This approach removes the quantum complexity of state preparation and eliminates the need to make any assumptions about the ground state of the system. As a test case, and to assess the scalability of the method, we applied our approach to the single-impurity Anderson model (SIAM) employed in dynamical mean-field theory. As a specific example, we present results for running the procedure for a two-site SIAM on a quantum simulator.
