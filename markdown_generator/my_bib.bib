abstract = {We report on a quantum-classical simulation of the single-band Hubbard model using two-site dynamical mean-field theory (DMFT). Our approach uses IBM's superconducting qubit chip to compute the zero-temperature impurity Green's function in the time domain and a classical computer to fit the measured Green's functions and extract their frequency domain parameters. We find that the quantum circuit synthesis (Trotter) and hardware errors lead to incorrect frequency estimates, and subsequently to an inaccurate quasiparticle weight when calculated from the frequency derivative of the self-energy. These errors produce incorrect hybridization parameters that prevent the DMFT algorithm from converging to the correct self-consistent solution. To avoid this pitfall, we compute the quasiparticle weight by integrating the quasiparticle peaks in the spectral function. This method is much less sensitive to Trotter errors and allows the algorithm to converge to self-consistency for a half-filled Mott insulating system after applying quantum error mitigation techniques to the quantum simulation data.},

abstract = {Dynamical mean-field theory (DMFT) maps the local Green's function of the Hubbard model to that of the Anderson impurity model and thus gives an approximate solution of the Hubbard model by solving the simpler quantum impurity model. Quantum and hybrid quantum-classical algorithms have been proposed to efficiently solve impurity models by preparing and evolving the ground state under the impurity Hamiltonian on a quantum computer instead of using intractable classical algorithms. We propose a highly optimized fast-forwarding quantum circuit to significantly improve quantum algorithms for the minimal DMFT problem preserving the Mott phase transition. Our Cartan decomposition based algorithm uses a fixed depth quantum circuit to eliminate time-discretization errors and evolve the initial state over arbitrary times. Exploiting the structure of the fast-forwarding circuits, we sufficiently reduce the gate cost to simulate the dynamics of, and extract frequencies from, the Anderson impurity model on noisy quantum hardware and demonstrate the Mott transition by mapping the phase-diagram of the corresponding impurity problem. Especially near the Mott phase transition when the quasiparticle resonance frequency converges to zero and evolving the system over long-time scales is necessary, our method maintains accuracy where Trotter error would otherwise dominate. This work presents the first computation of the Mott phase transition using noisy digital quantum hardware, made viable by a highly optimized computation in terms of gate depth, simulation error, and run-time on quantum hardware. The combination of algebraic circuit decompositions and model specific error mitigation techniques used may have applications extending beyond our use case to solving correlated electronic phenomena on noisy quantum computers.},

@article{Keen2021,
abstract = {We propose quantum algorithms for projective ground-state preparation and calculations of the many-body Green's functions directly in frequency domain. The algorithms are based on the linear combination of unitary (LCU) operations and essentially only use quantum resources. To prepare the ground state, we construct the operator ${\exp}(-\tau \hat{H}^2)$ using Hubbard-Stratonovich transformation by LCU and apply it on an easy-to-prepare initial state. Our projective state preparation procedure saturates the near-optimal scaling, $\mathcal{O}(\frac{1}{\gamma\Delta} \log \frac{1}{\gamma\eta})$, of other currently known algorithms, in terms of the spectral-gap lower bound $\Delta$, the additive error $\eta$ in the state vector, and the overlap lower bound $\gamma$ between the initial state and the exact ground state. It is straightforward to combine our algorithm with spectral-gap amplification technique to achieve quadratically improved scaling $\mathcal{O}(1/\sqrt{\Delta})$ for ground-state preparation of frustration-free Hamiltonians, which we demonstrate with numerical results of the $q$-deformed XXZ chain. To compute the Green's functions, including the single-particle and other response functions, we act on the prepared ground state with the retarded resolvent operator $R(\omega + i\Gamma; \hat{H})$ in the LCU form derived from the Fourier-Laplace integral transform (FIT). Our resolvent algorithm has $\mathcal{O}(\frac{1}{\Gamma^2} \log\frac{1}{\Gamma\epsilon})$ complexity scaling for the frequency resolution $\Gamma$ of the response functions and the targeted error $\epsilon$, while classical algorithms for FIT usually have polynomial scaling over the error $\epsilon$. To illustrate the complexity scaling of our algorithms, we provide numerical results for their application to the paradigmatic Fermi-Hubbard model on a one-dimensional lattice with different numbers of sites.},

abstract = {Quantum algorithms on noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) devices are expected to soon simulate quantum systems that are classically intractable. However, the non-negligible gate error present on NISQ devices impedes the implementation of many purely quantum algorithms, necessitating the use of hybrid quantum-classical algorithms. One such hybrid quantum-classical algorithm, is based upon quantum computed Hamiltonian moments (Formula presented.) (Formula presented.), with respect to quantum state (Formula presented.). In this tutorial review, we will give a brief review of these quantum algorithms with focuses on the typical ways of computing Hamiltonian moments using quantum hardware and improving the accuracy of the estimated state energies based on the quantum computed moments. We also present a computation of the Hamiltonian moments of a four-site Heisenberg model and compute the energy and magnetization of the model utilizing the imaginary time evolution on current IBM-Q hardware. Finally, we discuss some possible developments and applications of Hamiltonian moment methods.},

abstract = {The three key elements of a quantum simulation are state preparation, time evolution, and measurement. While the complexity scaling of dynamics and measurements are well known, many state preparation methods are strongly system-dependent and require prior knowledge of the system's eigenvalue spectrum. Here, we report on a quantum-classical implementation of the coupled-cluster Green's function (CCGF) method, which replaces explicit ground state preparation with the task of applying unitary operators to a simple product state. While our approach is broadly applicable to a wide range of models, we demonstrate it here for the Anderson impurity model (AIM). The method requires a number of T gates that grows as $ \mathcal{O} \left(N^5 \right)$ per time step to calculate the impurity Green's function in the time domain, where $N$ is the total number of energy levels in the AIM. For comparison, a classical CCGF calculation of the same order would require computational resources that grow as $ \mathcal{O} \left(N^6 \right)$ per time step.},
