My name is Trevor Keen and I am currently a PhD Candidate in Physics at the University of Tennessee, Knoxville. I work on quantum computational simulations of condensed matter systems, with focuses both on implementation using current quantum devices, and algorithmic development for fault-tolerant quantum computers. Although my background is in physics and mathematics, I have picked up many computational skills along the way. Please peruse my [publications](https://tkeen94.github.io/publications/) and [talks](https://tkeen94.github.io/talks/).

Background
======
I received a B.S. in Computational Physics and a B.S. in Mathematics from Southern Illinois University (SIU), Carbondale in Carbondale, IL, in 2017. My research career began with an undergraduate research assistantship working with Dr. Mark Byrd on the theory of open quantum systems. During my time at Southern Illinois University, I became a Ronald E. McNair scholar. This program allowed me to conduct research during the summer between my penultimate and final year at SIU. During this research experience, I gained valuable skills in research and computing. After my graduation from SIU, I immediately started the physics PhD program at the University of Tennessee, Knoxville (UTK) in Fall 2017. I received my M.S. in physics from UTK in 2020, en route to my PhD.

Current Work
======
I am a student under Professor Steven Johnston working in quantum computational simulations of condensed matter systems. My main interests lie in simulating models that have some sort of exponential scaling when simulated using classical methods, but have their exponential scaling alleviated when quantum computers are used.

Examples of these systems include strongly correlated electron models which suffer from an exponential scaling in computation time (e.g. quantum Monte Carlo) or in memory resources required (e.g. exact diagonalization). Quantum computers allow ways around this exponential scaling, paving the way for simulations of large quantum systems.
