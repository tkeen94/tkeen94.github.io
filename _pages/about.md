My name is Trevor Keen and I am currently a PhD Candidate in Physics at the University of Tennessee, Knoxville. I work on quantum computational simulations of condensed matter systems, with focuses both on implementation using current quantum devices, and algorithmic development for fault-tolerant quantum computers. Although my background is in physics and mathematics, I have picked up many computational skills along the way. Please peruse my [publications](https://tkeen94.github.io/publications/) and [talks](https://tkeen94.github.io/talks/).
