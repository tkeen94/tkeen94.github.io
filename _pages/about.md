My name is Trevor Keen and I am currently a PhD Candidate in Physics at the University of Tennessee, Knoxville. I work on quantum computational simulations of condensed matter systems, with focuses both on implementation using current quantum devices, and algorithmic development for fault-tolerant quantum computers. Although my background is in physics and mathematics, I have picked up many computational skills along the way. Please peruse my [publications](https://tkeen94.github.io/publications/) and [talks](https://tkeen94.github.io/talks/).

Background
======
I received a B.S. in Computational Physics and a B.S. in Mathematics from Southern Illinois University (SIU), Carbondale in Carbondale, IL, in 2017. My research career began with an undergraduate research assistantship working with Dr. Mark Byrd on the theory of open quantum systems. During my time at Southern Illinois University, I became a Ronald E. McNair scholar. This program allowed me to conduct research during the summer between my penultimate and final year at SIU.
